                This covid-19 situation has gotten out of hand and we need to do something about it collectively. We need to address the fact that the most infected age group is 18-24, which means that young adults don’t take this as serious as it is, or they can’t do anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If everyone should feel safe to be out in public without the risk of getting infected, everyone needs to wear a face mask. Since face masks don’t stop people from attracting the virus but it does stop it from spreading it to other people, if everyone were to wear one it would negate some of the spread. Everyone should wear a face mask while out in public, even teenagers and young adults, because not only do the authorities recommend it, but it would also comfort a lot of people. It would make older people feel more safe and it will be easier on the people working in the hospitals.
