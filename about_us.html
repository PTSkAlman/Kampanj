            <p>
                We are a group of people who focuses on spreading awareness and information about the covid-19 situation. We want people to know the recommendations and regulations authorities have put up. People of all ages should feel safe. You shouldnâ€™t have to fear doing day to day tasks, like going grocery shopping or just being at your job. We want this pandemic to end as soon as possible, but for that to happen with minimum casualties, everyone needs to follow the regulations. We want the people to stall as much time as possible in the wait for the vaccines, without spreading the virus. Then we can all resume with our lives before the pandemic.
